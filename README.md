# MyPortfolio

ðŸ“–Weekly Challenge 2
Implemented the following user story:


## User Story

AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position



## Acceptance Criteria
* It's done when there are semantic HTML elements.

* It's done when it contains the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.

* It's done when the UI scrolls to the corresponding section when the header links are clicked.

* It's done when the work section UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications when the link to work is clicked. 

* It's done when the first application's image should be larger in size than the others.

* It's done when the image of the application takes you to that deployed application. 

* It's done when the page is responsive and adapts to your viewport.
